## Hearts of Iron IV

**Patch 1.17.3** · Devs on holiday break until January 2026

The community sentiment reveals mounting frustration with core mechanics, particularly naval AI following recent DLC releases.

### Naval AI Crisis

The naval AI remains the most pressing concern. Key issues raised:

- Strike force placement is "generally faulty"
- AI cannot be made to ASW-hunt submarines
- Too many single-taskforce fleets leave many without admirals
- Major powers like Britain fail to establish convoy protection

> "Navy AI before 1.17 was relatively more flexible and competent... the new AI system just can't make that happen again."
> — Community modder

### DLC Quality Concerns

The recent **"Nod & Crescent Sun"** DLC has introduced gameplay-breaking bugs:

- Manchuria reportedly "unplayable" — Japan spawns Reorganized China in player territory
- "Ghost supply hubs" provide infinite supply to encircled enemies
- Siege mechanics broken

> "Every time I check Reddit, I'm vindicated for not buying this DLC."

### Mechanics Under Scrutiny

Peace conferences and capitulation continue to frustrate. Players report unexpected outcomes — like Brazil capitulating to the USSR despite no South American involvement.

> "I'm honestly done. This game is so broken sometimes."
> — Japan player

### Looking Ahead: HOI5 Debate

A philosophical discussion is emerging around focus trees:

**Critics argue:**
- Focus trees are "inherently casual and unchallenging"
- Core mechanics have become shallower

**Defenders note:**
- Provide clarity about available options
- Prevent "blind guessing" of earlier titles

### Developer Response

PDX_Gorion confirmed continued patch development in 2026 and acknowledged map mode bugs. However, naval fixes remain unaddressed during the holiday break.

**Bottom line:** A mature game struggling with technical debt. Long-standing issues overshadow new content, pushing the community toward mods and console commands.

## Victoria 3

**Version 1.12.2** · Beta 1.12.3 released Dec 19

The game remains in a challenging state. The beta addresses critical bugs while the community grapples with fundamental economic and performance issues.

### Performance Crisis

Late-game performance continues to degrade:

- 1900 saves take **1+ minutes** to process a year (even on 9800X3D)
- Campaigns become "quite a slog of hitching" especially during saves
- Performance benchmark thread has 420+ replies

### Japan: Near-Unplayable

Japan has become a focal point for frustration. The 1.12 update introduced severe imbalances:

- Millions of radicals due to insufficient standard of living
- Nerfed investment pool means not enough jobs
- Unemployment spiral leads to "inevitable slide towards bankruptcy"

> "Japan is just done for now."
> — Experienced player

### Investment Pool Nerf

A major 1.12 change removed the investment pool multiplier for low-GDP countries:

- Economic development dramatically slowed for smaller nations
- Private construction queues nearly empty
- Before: queue "flooded with months of construction"
- Now: "rarely get 3-4 buildings at MAX"

**Bottom line:** Substantial rebalancing needed before core gameplay loops become enjoyable for traditional economy countries.
